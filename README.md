# Summary

This repository demonstrates two dashboards I created for two of my courses in my MSBA program (Dashboard and Visualization). 

The ["Movie Review"](https://github.com/vincyxia/dashboard-and-visualization/blob/master/Movie_Review.pdf) dashboard is a movie industry overview in terms of financial, customer, internal growth from 2012 to 2016.

The ["World Happiness Report"](https://github.com/vincyxia/dashboard-and-visualization/blob/master/World%20Hapiness%20Report.pdf) dashboard is a report of world hapiness, including highest and lowest continent happiness score analysis, trending analysis, and positive and negative effects analysis.
